nuxeo-talend-extension
=======================


## Building / Installing

There is no automated build, at least for now.

To make it work you need to :

 - check out Talend Studio source code
 - setup an Eclipse RCP build that build Talend Open Studio
 - add the 2 Nuxeo bundles in the target platform

## Goal

Since Nuxeo API is dynamic, the goal of these repository extensions was to hold meta-data for :

 - Nuxeo doc types and schemas
 - Nuxeo Operations
