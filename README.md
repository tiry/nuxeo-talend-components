=======================

This repository contains basic Talend components and extensions to access Nuxeo Platform via the http APIs.

The 2 children directory contain different kind of Talend related code

## Components 

The [components](components) dir contains 'javajet' Talend components for Reading/Writing documents inside Nuxeo.

See the [ReadMe file](components/README.md) for more details.

NB : This part should be workable.

## Extensions

The extensions dir contains an extension bundle to contribute to Talend metadata repository.

The goal was to be able to use Talend metadata repository to introspects Nuxeo operations and schemas.

NB : This part is a work in progress and does not work for real.
